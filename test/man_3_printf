.SH SYNOPSIS
.B _printf
Holberton Group Project to write an implementation of our own printf function.

Recreation of printf function, following Holberton School specifications, from the standard library. _printf() will generate an output based on a format specified and will write the output into the standard output.
.PP
.B Some of the general requirements are:

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called holberton.h
    Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

.B Authorized functions and macros:

    write (man 2 write)
    malloc (man 3 malloc)

- Prints a string.

.B 		&&
- Prints a % (Percentage or modulo sign).

.B 		%d
- Prints a signed decimal integer.

.B 		%i
- Prints a integer.

.B 		%b
- Prints an unsigned int converted to binary.

.B 		%u
- Prints unsigned decimal integer.

.B 		%o
- Prints number converted to octal.

.B 		%x
- Prints number converted to hexadecimal (lowercase).

.B 		%X
- Prints number converted to hexadecimal (uppercase).

.SH OPTIONS
.SH EXAMPLES
.SH RETURN/EXIT VALUES
if format == NULL then _printf() returns -1. Otherwise it will return length of stting or conversion specifier.

.SH BUGS
Two checkers are missing from task 0 of proyect printf. Further research required. Will update promptly.
